# Decentralised-Kademlia-File-Storage
A very basic decentralised file storage system using the Kademlia distributed hash table and the IOTA token. 

The code is inside the Server.js file. If you want a more in-depth look at the process I went through to code it I suggest you check out the Development Log.
